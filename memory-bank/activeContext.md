# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Dataset Analysis**: deeply analyzing the PadChest-GR dataset attributes and data quality.
- **Documentation**: Updating the project documentation to reflect findings.

## Recent Changes
- **Detailed EDA**: Performed extensive Exploratory Data Analysis in `analysis.ipynb`:
    - **Null Value Analysis**: Identified high missing values in `progression_status` (92%) and `prior_imageID` (64%).
    - **Duplicate Checking**: Confirmed dataset is in long-format (multiple rows per image).
    - **Image Verification**: Verified presence of images, including nested directory structure for prior studies.
    - **Demographics**: Visualized Patient Age and Sex distributions.
    - **Validation Status**: Discovered 100% of the dataset is `study_is_validation=False` (not manually validated).
    - **Benchmark Status**: Discovered 100% of the dataset is `study_is_benchmark=True` (it's the official benchmark set).
    - **Label Analysis**: Visualized Normal vs Pathology distribution.

## Next Steps
- Create `README.md` to summarize the project and analysis results.
- (Future) Begin data filtering or preprocessing for model training.

## Active Decisions
- **Dataset Nature**: Recognized that the dataset is the "Benchmark" subset of PadChest, meaning it's a fixed standard test set, even if labels are not manually validated.
- **Data Loading**: Future data loaders must handle the long-format CSV (aggregating labels per ImageID).

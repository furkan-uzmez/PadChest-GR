# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Initialization**: Setting up the Memory Bank and understanding the project structure.
- **Data Exploration**: Understanding the contents of `dataset/` to plan next steps.

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank structure (`memory-bank/` directory and core files).
- Created `analysis.ipynb` for dataset exploration.
- Updated `requirements.txt` with data science libraries.

## Next Steps
- Run the notebook to verify data loading.
- Analyze the structure of the JSON data in more detail.
- Define specific analysis goals based on user feedback.

## Active Decisions
- Using `memory-bank/` directory for documentation to keep root clean.
- Added standard data science stack (`pandas`, `matplotlib`) to requirements.
